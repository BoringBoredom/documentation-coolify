  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey).">
    Error: `Server is not reachable. Reason: root@host.docker.internal: Permission denied (publickey).`

    Your Coolify instance cannot reach the server it is running on. During installation, a public key is generated to `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub` and automatically added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

    If it is not added, you can add it manually by running the following command on your server:

    ```bash
    cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

  <Accordion title="Cannot connect to database during build phase.">
   Some applications / libraries (Prisma) need to connect to the database during the build phase, to run migrations for example.

    ### Nixpacks
    To do so, you need to set the database to public. You can do so by going to your database and clicking on `Accessible over the internet`.

    > We are working on a better solution for this.

    ## Other
    Other build packs could reach database internally - if they are placed in the same network. You can check this by going to the `Server` tab on both resources and check if they are in the same network and server.

<Accordion title="Root password reset without SMTP.">
From `v4.0.0-beta.58`, you can use the following method to reset the root user's password, in case you forgot and do not have an SMTP server set, so you cannot request a forgot password.

Login to your server through SSH and execute the following command:

```bash
docker exec -ti coolify bash -c "php artisan root:reset-password"
```
