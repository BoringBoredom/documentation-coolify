Due to trademark issues, we can't make a fully automated installation for Plausible Analytics. But don't worry, it's still easy to install it.

## Installation
1. You need to select the `Based on Docker Compose` application type where you can add any docker-compose file you want.
2. Copy the following [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coollabsio/coolify/main/templates/compose/plausible.yaml) to the input box (with the comments).
3. Click on the `Save` button.
4. Go to the `Plausible` service's settings page (gear icon on the right side).
5. Add your custom domain name to the `FQDN` input box.
6. Click on the `Save` button.
7. Click on the `Deploy` button.
