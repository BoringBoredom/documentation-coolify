You can easily uninstall Coolify by stopping the following containers,
`coolify`,`coolify-db`, `coolify-proxy`, `coolify-redis` and `coolify-realtime` or by executing the following script:

```bash
docker stop -t 0 coolify coolify-db coolify-proxy coolify-redis coolify-realtime
docker rm coolify coolify-db coolify-proxy coolify-redis coolify-realtime
```

You also need to cleanup all the docker volumes as well.

```bash
docker volume rm coolify-db coolify-redis
```
