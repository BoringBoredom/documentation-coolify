API request requires a `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header, which could be generated from the UI.


# Generate a Token
1. Go to `Keys & Tokens` / `API tokens`.
2. Define a name for your token and click `Create New Token`.

<Tip>
You will see the token once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.
</Tip>

# Scope
The token will only be able to access resources that are owned by the team that the token is scoped to.
