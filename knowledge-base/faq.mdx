## Server
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey).">
    Error: `Server is not reachable. Reason: root@host.docker.internal: Permission denied (publickey).`

    Your Coolify instance cannot reach the server it is running on. During installation, a public key is generated to `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub` and automatically added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

    If it is not added, you can add it manually by running the following command on your server:

    ```bash
    cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom SSH Port">
  If you would like to use a custom SSH port, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.

  If you are self-hosting Coolify, you can simply set it after you installed Coolify on the `localhost` server.

    <Accordion title="Increase Concurrent Builds">
  If you would like to increase the number of concurrent builds, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.

## Applications

  <Accordion title="How to map a port the server?">
  If you want to map a port the host system (server), you need to use [Ports Mappings](/knowledge-base/applications#port-mappings) feature.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Database
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot connect to database during build phase.">
   Some applications / libraries (Prisma) need to connect to the database during the build phase, to run migrations for example.

    ### Nixpacks
    To do so, you need to set the database to public. You can do so by going to your database and clicking on `Accessible over the internet`.

    > We are working on a better solution for this.

    ## Other
    Other build packs could reach database internally - if they are placed in the same network. You can check this by going to the `Server` tab on both resources and check if they are in the same network and server.
