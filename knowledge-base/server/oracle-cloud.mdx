If you are using `Oracle Cloud free ARM server`, you need to do a few extra steps to use it in Coolify, as a `Coolify instance` or just a `remote server`.

## Setup Root User
By default, you can't login as root user. You need to do the following steps to enable root user.

1. Switch to root user `sudo su -`
2. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change `PermitRootLogin` to `without-password`.
3. Restart ssh service `service sshd restart`
4. Add a public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file which is also defined in your Coolify instance.

## Firewall Rules
This is only required if you self-host Coolify on Oracle ARM server.

By default, Oracle ARM server has a firewall enabled and you need to allow some ports to use Coolify.
