## Self-hosted version
For self-hosting Coolify, you need to allow some ports on your firewall.

- For Coolify: `8000` (http), `6001` (websocket) and `22` (SSH, or a custom port) (required)
- Reverse Proxy: `80, 443` (optional)

<Warning>
If you are using `Oracle Cloud Free ARM Server`, you need to allow these ports inside Oracle's Dashboard, otherwise you cannot reach your instance from the internet after installation.
</Warning>

- For GitHub integration, check [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-githubs-ip-addresses).
  

## Cloud version
If you need the public facing IPs to allow inbound connections to your servers, please [contact us](/contact).
