The configuration is slightly different for `Standard Applications` and `Docker Compose` based applications/one-click services.

All you need to do is to set custom labels on your application.

## Standard Applications

```bash
traefik.http.middlewares.custom-auth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG
traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=custom-auth
```

<Tip>
You most likely have a `traefik.http.middlewares` label already set. In that case, you can append the `custom-auth` middleware to the existing value.
For example:

```bash
traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=gzip,custom-auth
```
</Tip>

In the example above, we are using `test` as username and `test` as password.

## Docker Compose based Applications & one-click Services

You only need to add the basicauth middleware.

```yaml
services:
  changedetection:
    labels:
      - 'traefik.http.middlewares.custom-auth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG'
```

In the example above, we are using `test` as username and `test` as password.

Enable `Escape special characters in labels?` when applying basic auth labels.

## How to generate user/password?

You need to set your username and password in the `basicauth.users` label.

You can generate one with the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) command:

```bash
htpasswd -nbB test test
```
