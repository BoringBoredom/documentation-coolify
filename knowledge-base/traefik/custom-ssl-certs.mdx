If you want to use custom SSL certificates with Traefik, you can easily do so by following the steps below.

On each server, `/data/coolify/proxy` is mounted into the Coolify Proxy (Traefik) container.

You can add your custom SSL certificates in the `/data/coolify/proxy/certs` directory.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate or request an SSL certificate">
    Generate or request an SSL certificate for your domain. It can be a
    self-signed certificate, a certificate from a public CA, or a certificate
    from Let's Encrypt.

    Read more [here](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) about certbot and Let's Encrypt.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the key and cert files to the server">
    Copy the key and cert files to the server where your resource that will use the certificate is running.
    Use `scp` or any other method to copy the files.
    
    It should be placed under `/data/coolify/proxy` directory, for example:
    
    ```bash
    scp /path/to/your/domain.cert root@your-server-ip:/data/coolify/proxy/certs/domain.cert
    scp /path/to/your/domain.key root@your-server-ip:/data/coolify/proxy/certs/domain.key
    ```

    <Tip>
    Make sure the directory `/data/coolify/proxy/certs` exists on the server.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Traefik">
  You can configure Traefik to use the custom SSL certificates by adding a dynamic configuration file through Coolify's UI or directly adding it to `/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic`:

```yaml
tls:
  certificates:
    - certFile: /traefik/certs/domain.cert
      keyFile: /traefik/certs/domain.key
    - certFile: /traefik/certs/domain2.cert
      keyFile: /traefik/certs/domain2.key
```

Traefik will automatically use this certificate if it matches the domain of the incoming request and the certificate in any of the provided files.

  </Step>
