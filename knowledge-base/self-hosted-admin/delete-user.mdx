This guide will show you how to delete a user from the self-hosted Coolify instance.

<Warning>
  If you delete a user, and Coolify still has connection to the servers, it will
  delete all the resources on the servers as well, not just from Coolify's
  database.
</Warning>

Only users who are in the `root` team can delete users from the UI.

- Go to the `Team` page.
- Switch to `Admin View` tab.

Here you can see all the users registered in Coolify. Click on the `Delete` button next to the user you want to delete.

## Deletion process

<Tip>The root team or root user cannot be deleted.</Tip>

Coolify iterate over all the teams of a user and decide of the followings:

### The user is alone in the team

The team and all resources from the server and from Coolify's database are deleted.

### The user is not alone in the team

1. The user is the owner/admin of the team and no other owners/admins found, but the team **has members**:
   - The ownership is transferred to the first user in the team who is not the owner/admin.
   - The user is removed from the team. No resources are deleted.
