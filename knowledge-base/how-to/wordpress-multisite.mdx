## Introduction

##

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Wordpress with one-click installation">
Add a Wordpress service with the one-click installation feature in Coolify.
</Step>
<Step title="Persist Wordpress files on the host machine">
Change the following lines in your `docker-compose.yml` file from the UI to persist the Wordpress files on the host machine:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "wordpress-files:/var/www/html"
```

to:

```yaml
volumes:
  - "./wordpress:/var/www/html"
```

This will mount the `wordpress` directory in the default configuration directory (`/data/coolify/services/<serviceUuid>/`) to the `/var/www/html` directory in the container.

This way, you can edit the files on your host machine and see the changes reflected in the container.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Wordpress">
Start the Wordpress service and configure it as you wish.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable all plugins">
1. Go to your Wordpress admin panel.
2. Go to `Plugins` -> `Installed Plugins`.
3. Select all plugins and choose `Deactivate` from the dropdown menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Multisite">
1. Open your `wp-config.php` file on the server and add the following lines:

```php
define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
```

Refresh your WordPress panel in your browser. You should now see a new menu item called `Network Setup` under the `Tools` menu.

</Step>
