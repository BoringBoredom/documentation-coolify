Currently supported S3 compatible storages are:
  - AWS
  - DigitalOcean Spaces
  - MinIO
  - Cloudflare's R2
  - Backblaze B2
  - Scaleway Object Storage

Other's could work, but not tested yet. If you test it, please let us know.

## S3 Client

Coolify uses MinIO's client, called [`mc`](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html), to copy the backup files to your S3 compatible storage.


## Verification
To be able to use your S3 compatible storage, you need to verify it first. Verification done with `ListObjectsV2` request to your specified bucket.

So you need to create a bucket first, and then you can verify it.


# Cloudflare R2

Cloudflare R2 is a new service from Cloudflare, which is a S3 compatible storage. You can use it with Coolify.

### Configuration
1. You need to create a bucket first.
2. Then you need to create a R2 API token with `Object Read & Write` permission. 
3. You can find the S3 client credentials when the token is created.
  - You will need the `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` and the `S3 endpoint` from this view.
4. You can use the details from the previous step to configure Coolify.
